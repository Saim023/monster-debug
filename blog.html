                                sessionStorage??</h3>

                            <p class="card-text">Answer: sessionStorage is quite similar to localStorage. The difference
                                is that while data in
                                localStorage doesn't expire, on the other hand, data in sessionStorage is cleared when
                                the page session
                                ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page
                                session gets
                                created and assigned to that particular tab.

                                scope??</h3>
                            <p class="card-text">Answer: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only
                                accessible within that function and
                                cannot be used outside that function. On the other hand, block scope is a variable when
                                declared inside
                                the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that
                                particular
                                condition or loop.

                            <p class="card-text">Answer: Event Loop used for monitoring the Call Stack and the Callback
                                Queue. If the Call Stack is
                                empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the
                                Call Stack, which
                                effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
